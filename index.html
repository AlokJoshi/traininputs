        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <div class="explanation">

          <p>The objective of the game is to become a Train Tycoon - by amassing a lot of money. You start with G$ 1,000,000. You decide on the trains you to want to start and the routes you want them to run on. You also decide on the number of passenger coaches and goods wagons each train must have. If you spend too much money (beyond what you have) you will be charged an interst rate (10% per period) by your bank. On the other hand you earn a little interest (5% per period) on the money you have in the bank</p>
          <p>You can review Passenger Demand and Ticket Prices in the Info menu item. Ticket prices do not change throughout the game and Passenger Demand is the current demand. Every period more passengers want to travel but if their travel demand is not met, some of them continue to wait but others are lost to alternative means of travel. Your detailed performance in G$(game money) can be viewed in the Performance menu item. How you are doing compared to other players can be viewed in the Leaderboard menu item. Your performance in terms of the G$ for the current period only is shown on the top left of your game screen along with the current period you are in. This also shows the State you are in and your options. State will be explained later.</p>
          <img src="menu_on_game_screen.PNG" title="Top part of the game screen"/>
          <p>On the game screen there are other indicators of performance as well. For instance the color of the coaches varies from light red to dark red based on the occupancy of the train. Higher the occupancy, darker the color. Also once the train takes off from a city, there is a green tag which displays the G$ earnings from tickets sold at that city for the train that most recently departed from that city. Same information, though more detailed, is also available for each train along the left edge of your game screen. This is shown only once you have started one or more trains. To display this info for other trains you press the <keytype>n</keytype> (next train info) key in the Running state.</p>
          <p>Note that if you log in before starting your game (or even while you are playing your game) your game data 
            will be saved and you will be able to resume playing any of your games. If you are not logged in, you can 
            still play the game but your game will be lost once you log out or exit the Train Tycoon web site.
          </p>
          <p>Try and become a <img src='toytrain.png'>Train Tycoon<img src='toytrain.png'> by Pd 500.</p>
          <p>If you are the impatient type you can speed up the game by clicking on the <keytype>+</keytype> key once or repeatedly in the Running state. This makes the time fly past faster. Similarly the game slows down with the <keytype>-</keytype> key. You can even make the time come to a full stop by pressing the  <keytype>p</keytype> key. It is for
            pausing the game so that you can take actions to achieve your goals without worrying about what might happen while you are at it. For instance once you are in the paused state you can press the <keytype>r</keytype> key to get into the route
            editing or the <keytype>t</keytype> key for getting in to the Train Editing state. 
          </p>
          <p>I am sure you are thinking that the game would be worth trying if you did not have to remember all these keys. Well infact you do not have to remember these keys. In the game screen, the top portion of the screen always shows your various states and what key presses do what!! Now you are thinking <img src='toytrain.png'>Train Tycoon<img src='toytrain.png'> is awesome!! If that thought is still eluding you, my hope is that you change your opinion once you play the game and the money starts rolling in!!!

        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p>At any time you will be in one of the following stages(states) of play</p>
          <h4>Route Editing State</h4>
          <div class="explanation">

            <p>Here the idea is to identify the route that your train should take between two or more cities. So you will click on one city and then on another city or a point between those cities and so on tracing the route from one city to 2 or more cities.</p>
            <p>As you continue to click, you will see lines between those points. While you will be clicking to draw straight
            lines, the game will automatically create curved lines between each pair of straight lines that meet an an angle.
            Note that since the train cannot take sharp turns, the angle beween 2 lines cannot be less than 90 degrees. Similarly each line
            has to be a reasonable size. These two are incorporated in the user interface by ensuring that the click
            results
            in a line only
            if both these conditions are true.
            If you want to delete the last point you clicked, you can press the <keytype>d</keytype> key. If you have completed one route
            and want to create another route, you will press the <keytype>a</keytype> or the <keytype>Escape</keytype> key. This will start the process
            of
            adding another
            route. Any number of routes can start at a city or end at a city or transit through a city.
            Once you have created the routes, they cannot be edited or deleted.
            When you have created one or more routes, you can press the <keytype>g</keytype> key to get into the game
            mode.
            However by
            default a train will get only three passenger coaches and one goods wagon. If you want to add a additional coach you should press the
            <keytype>t
            </keytype> key for Train Editing
            and add a coach by pressing the <keytype>+</keytype> key.
            A separate train will run on each of the routes.
            Cost of the track is proportional to the distance of the route.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Train Editing State</h4>
          <div class="explanation">

            <p>Each route will automatically get one train. By default the train will consist of an engine and one
              passenger
              coach. If you want to add
              another coach to the train, you will need to press the plus(<keytype>+</keytype>) key. To remove one coach
              from
              the train you will
              press the minus key(<keytype>-</keytype>).
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Paused State</h4>
          <div class="explanation">

            <p>You can pause the game. When you do this you will be in a Paused State. Time stops in this state. Once
              you
              are
              in the paused state you can go to Route Editing State (r key), Train Editing State(t key). Note that when
              you
              come
              back to Route Editing State from the Paused state, you have to click on the a key to start adding another
              route.
              You go back to the running state by pressing the <keytype>g</keytype> key.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Running State</h4>
          <div class="explanation">

            <p>In this state you should see your trains moving around from one station to another. Also in this state on
              the
              left
              of your screen you should see the number of passengers the train has boarded for each of the destinations
              and
              the
              money that has earned you. In this state, if you hover your cursor over any city, you get to see some
              relevant
              info.
            </p>
            <p>Press <keytype>space</keytype> key to switch back to the game graphics screen</p>
          </div>
          <h4>How to get to these states?</h4>
          <div class="explanation">

            <p>Here again we use keyboard keys to get to various states</p>
            <p>The keys you can press to get to various states are shown at the very top of the game graphics screen at
              all
              times</p>
            <p>You always start in the Route Editing state</p>
            <p>Typically once you finish creating a route you will press the <keytype>t</keytype> key to switch to the
              Train
              Editing state
              and add additional coaches if you need to</p>
            <p>Having done this you will typically switch to the Running State by pressing the <keytype>g</keytype> key
              to
              resume the game.</p>
            <p>
              <keytype>d</keytype> will switch you to the Route Editing State if you are not in Running State
            </p>
            <p>Generally speaking you will use the following keys to switch to various states</p>
            <p>
              <keytype>t</keytype> will switch you to the Train Editing State if you are not in Running State. To go
              from
              Running State to Train Editing State
              you have to press the <keytype>p</keytype> key to go to Paused State
            </p>
            <p>
              <keytype>p</keytype> will switch you to the Paused State if you are in the Running State
            </p>
            <p>
              <keytype>g</keytype> for game, will switch you to the Running State
            </p>
            <p>
              <keytype>space</keytype> key, will switch you to the documentation screen. If you are already in this
              screen,
              the <keytype>space</keytype> key
              will switch you back to the Game graphics screen
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation">
        <h4>Costs in G$(Game Dollars)</h4>
        <p><b>Track:</b> Depends on the distance. It is about G$ 1000
          per unit distance ie per pixel on the screen. However going over
          the lake, while possible, will cost you about 20 times of the
          regular track cost. Similarly you can go under the snow covered mountain
          through a tunnel but that too will cost you 20 times the regular track
          cost.
        </p>
        <p><b>Engine:</b> The Engine costs G$ 100000
          and this engine can pull any number of passenger coaches</p>
        <p><b>Passenger Coach:</b> Each Passenger Coach costs G$ 20000.
          Note that if you reduce the number of coaches, the coach does not earn
          you any resale. Each passenger coach has a capacity of 30
          passengers. Also note that when passengers are boarded, the passengers
          for the farthest destination are boarded first and so on for the
          remaining destinations (from farthest to closest destination) if there is any coach capacity left.
        </p>
        <p><b>Station:</b> Each Station costs G$ 50000.
        </p>
        <p><b>Maintainance Cost:</b> This proportional to the total capital cost
        </p>
        <p><b>Running Cost:</b> This proportional to the total track length, and number of Stations
        </p>
        <p><b>Depreciation Cost:</b> The depreciation is calculated internally to work out the profit after
          depreciation
          for
          taxation purposes. The depreciation is a straight line depreciation over 200 periods.
          However, it flows back in to the cash and your cash balance reflects that.
        </p>
        <p>You have no control over Maintenance Cost, Running Cost and Depreciation</p>
        <p>Once a train is started on any given route, there is no way to stop the train in this version of the
          game.
        </p>

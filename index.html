        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <div class="explanation">

          <p>The objective of the game is to become a Train Tycoon - by amassing a lot of money.</p>
          <p>You start with G$ 1,000,000</p>
          <p>You decide on the number of trains to start</p>
          <p>You decide on the route you want your train to take and the stations it must stop and the number of
            passenger
            coaches it must have</p>
          <p>If you spend too much money (beyond what you have) you will be charged a steep interst rate (10%) by your
            bank/financiers</p>
          <p>You earn a little interest (5%) on the money you have in the bank</p>
          <p>You can review Passenger Demand and Ticket Prices in the Info menu item.</p>
          <p>Your performance in terms of the G$ is shown on the top left of your screen along with the current period
            you
            are in. This also shows the State you are in and your options.
            You can review your detailed performance in the Performance menu item.</p>
          Also note that the color of the coaches varies from light red to dark red based on the occupancy of the
          train. Higher the occupancy, darker the color.
          <p>You train-wise performance can be seen on the left of your game screen (most recent on top). You can
            switch
            between the trains by pressing the <keytype>n</keytype> (next train info> key in the Running state.
          </p>
          <p>Note that the data is not saved anywhere. Hence you will need to start again once you close the Game
            browser
            window
            or the computer.
          </p>
          <p>Try and become a Train Tycoon by Pd 500.</p>
          <p>You can speed up the game by clicking on the <keytype>+</keytype> key once or repeatedly in the Running
            state.
            This makes the time
            pass fast.
            Similarly the game slows down with the <keytype>-</keytype> key. <keytype>p</keytype> key is ofcourse for
            pausing the game. Once you are in the Paused
            state you can add another route, by first pressing the <keytype>r</keytype> key to get into the route
            editing
            state and then by pressing the
            <keytype>a</keytype> key to add a route and then clicking on the starting station and so forth. Similarly
            from
            the paused state you can add or remove coaches
            in any of the existing trains. You do this by first pressing the <keytype>t</keytype> for getting in to
            the
            Train Editing state and then selecting the right
            train by pressing the <keytype>n</keytype> key and once the correct train is selected, pressing the
            <keytype>+
            </keytype> to add a coach and <keytype>-</keytype> to
            remove a coach.

          <table id="passengers">

          <p>Ticket Prices</p>
          <table id="ticketprices">
          </table>
          <h4>Costs in G$(Game Dollars)</h4>
          <p><b>Track:</b> Depends on the distance. It is about G$ 1000
            per unit distance ie per pixel on the screen. However going over
            the lake, while possible, will cost you about 20 times of the
            regular track cost. Similarly you can go under the snow covered mountain
            through a tunnel but that too will cost you 20 times the regular track
            cost.
          </p>
          <p><b>Engine:</b> The Engine costs G$ 100000
            and this engine can pull any number of passenger coaches</p>
          <p><b>Passenger Coach:</b> Each Passenger Coach costs G$ 20000.
            Note that if you reduce the number of coaches, the coach does not earn
            you any resale. Each passenger coach has a capacity of 30
            passengers. Also note that when passengers are boarded, the passengers
            for the farthest destination are boarded first and so on for the
            remaining destinations (from farthest to closest destination) if there is any coach capacity left.
          </p>
          <p><b>Station:</b> Each Station costs G$ 50000.
          </p>
          <p><b>Maintainance Cost:</b> This proportional to the total capital cost
          </p>
          <p><b>Running Cost:</b> This proportional to the total track length, and number of Stations
          </p>
          <p><b>Depreciation Cost:</b> The depreciation is calculated internally to work out the profit after
            depreciation
            for
            taxation purposes. The depreciation is a straight line depreciation over 200 periods.
            However, it flows back in to the cash and your cash balance reflects that.
          </p>
          <p>You have no control over Maintenance Cost, Running Cost and Depreciation</p>
          <p>Once a train is started on any given route, there is no way to stop the train in this version of the
            game.
          </p>
          <h4>Switching Between Game Screen and this screen</h4>
          <p>The <keytype>space</keytype> bar will switch between the game screen and this screen.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id='how'>
        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <div class="explanation">
          <p>At any time you will be in one of the following stages(states) of play</p>
          <h4>Route Editing State</h4>
          <div class="explanation">

            <p>Here the idea is to identify the route that your train should take between two or more cities. So you
              will
              click on one city and then on another city or a point between those cities and so on tracing the route
              from
              one
              city to 2 or more
              cities. As you continue to click, you will see lines between those points. While you will be clicking to
              draw
              straight
              lines, the game will automatically create curved lines between each pair of straight lines that meet an an
              angle.
              Note that since the train cannot take sharp turns, the angle beween 2 lines cannot be less than 90
              degrees.
              Similarly each line
              has to be a reasonable size. These two are incorporated in the user interface by ensuring that the click
              results
              in a line only
              if both these conditions are true.
              If you to delete the last point you clicked, you can press the <keytype>d</keytype> key. If you have
              completed
              one route
              and want to create another route, you will press the <keytype>a</keytype> key. This will start the process
              of
              adding another
              route. Any number of routes can start at a city or end at a city or transit through a city.
              Once you have created the routes, they cannot be edited or deleted.
              When you have created one or more routes, you can press the <keytype>g</keytype> key to get into the game
              mode.
              However by
              default a train will get only one coach. If you want to add a additional coach you should press the
              <keytype>t
              </keytype> key for Train Editing
              and add a coach by pressing the <keytype>+</keytype> key.
              A separate train will run on each of the routes.
              Cost of the track is proportional to the distance of the route.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Train Editing State</h4>
          <div class="explanation">

            <p>Each route will automatically get one train. By default the train will consist of an engine and one
              passenger
              coach. If you want to add
              another coach to the train, you will need to press the plus(<keytype>+</keytype>) key. To remove one coach
              from
              the train you will
              press the minus key(<keytype>-</keytype>).
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Paused State</h4>
          <div class="explanation">

            <p>You can pause the game. When you do this you will be in a Paused State. Time stops in this state. Once
              you
              are
              in the paused state you can go to Route Editing State (r key), Train Editing State(t key). Note that when
              you
              come
              back to Route Editing State from the Paused state, you have to click on the a key to start adding another
              route.
              You go back to the running state by pressing the <keytype>g</keytype> key.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Running State</h4>
          <div class="explanation">

            <p>In this state you should see your trains moving around from one station to another. Also in this state on
              the
              left
              of your screen you should see the number of passengers the train has boarded for each of the destinations
              and
              the
              money that has earned you. In this state, if you hover your cursor over any city, you get to see some
              relevant
              info.
            </p>
            <p>Press <keytype>space</keytype> key to switch back to the game graphics screen</p>
          </div>
          <h4>How to get to these states?</h4>
          <div class="explanation">

            <p>Here again we use keyboard keys to get to various states</p>
            <p>The keys you can press to get to various states are shown at the very top of the game graphics screen at
              all
              times</p>
            <p>You always start in the Route Editing state</p>
            <p>Typically once you finish creating a route you will press the <keytype>t</keytype> key to switch to the
              Train
              Editing state
              and add additional coaches if you need to</p>
            <p>Having done this you will typically switch to the Running State by pressing the <keytype>g</keytype> key
              to
              resume the game.</p>
            <p>
              <keytype>d</keytype> will switch you to the Route Editing State if you are not in Running State
            </p>
            <p>Generally speaking you will use the following keys to switch to various states</p>
            <p>
              <keytype>t</keytype> will switch you to the Train Editing State if you are not in Running State. To go
              from
              Running State to Train Editing State
              you have to press the <keytype>p</keytype> key to go to Paused State
            </p>
            <p>
              <keytype>p</keytype> will switch you to the Paused State if you are in the Running State
            </p>
            <p>
              <keytype>g</keytype> for game, will switch you to the Running State
            </p>
            <p>
              <keytype>space</keytype> key, will switch you to the documentation screen. If you are already in this
              screen,
              the <keytype>space</keytype> key
              will switch you back to the Game graphics screen

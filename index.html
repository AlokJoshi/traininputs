      <h3>How to Play</h3>
      <p>At any time you will be in one of the following stages(states) of play</p>
      <h4>Route Editing State</h4>
      <p>Here the idea is to identify the route that your train should take between two or more cities. So you will
        click
        on one city
        and then on another city or a point between those cities and so on tracing the route from one city to 2 or more
        cities. As
        you continue to click, you will see lines between those points. While you will be clicking to draw straight
        lines,
        the game
        will automatically create curved lines between each pair of straight lines.
        If you to delete the last point you clicked, you can press the 'd' key. If you have completed one route
        and want to create another route, you will press the 'a' key. This will start the process of adding another route.
        Once you have created the routes, they cannot be edited or deleted.
        When you have created one or more routes, you can press the 'g' key to get into the game mode.
        A separate train will run on each of the routes.
        Cost of the track is proportional to the distance of the route.
      </p>
      <h4>Train Editing State</h4>
      <p>Each route will automatically get one train. By default the train will consist of an engine and one passenger
        coach. If you want to add
        another coach to the train, you will need to press the plus(+) key. To remove one coach from the train you will
        click on the minus(-).
      </p>
      <h4>Paused State</h4>
      <p>You can pause the game. When you do this you will be in a Paused State. Time stops in this state.
      </p>
      <h4>Running State</h4>
      <p>In this state you should see your trains moving around from one station to another.
      </p>
      <h4>How to get to these states?</h4>
      <p>Here again we use keyboard keys to get to various states</p>
      <p>'r' will switch you to the Route Editing State if you are not in Running State</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clicking within the blue circle for any city will start the process of creating a route. Click at 
          points between and then inside the blue circle of the destination city.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>'s' will switch you to the Station Editing State if you are not in Running State</p>
      <p>'t' will switch you to the Train Editing State if you are not in Running State</p>
      <p>'p' will switch you to the Paused State if you are in the Running State</p>
      <p>'g' will switch you to the Running State</p>

    <div id='objective'>
      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>The objective of the game is to become a Train Tycoon - by amassing a lot of money.</p>
      <p>You start with {{x}} amount of money</p>
      <p>You decide on the number of trains to start</p>
      <p>You decide on the route you want your train to take and the stations it must stop and the number of passenger
        coaches it must have</p>
      <p>If you spend too much money (beyond what you have) you will be charged a steep interst rate by your
        bank/financiers</p>
      <p>You earn a little interest on the money you have in the bank</p>
      <p>You can review Passenger Demand and Ticket Prices in the Info menu item.</p>
      <p>You can review your performance in the Performance menu item.</p>
